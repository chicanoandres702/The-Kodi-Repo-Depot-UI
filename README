# Kodi Repository Uploader

This tool provides a simple web interface for uploading and managing Kodi add-ons in your own repository.

## Features

* **Easy Upload:** Upload add-on ZIP files through a web interface with drag-and-drop support.
* **Repository Management:**  Create and configure your Kodi repository with custom name, ID, version, and provider.
* **Add-on Listing:** View a list of uploaded add-ons with their icons and basic information.
* **Deletion:**  Delete add-ons from your repository.
* **Automatic XML Generation:**  Automatically generates and updates the `addons.xml` file for your repository.
* **MD5 Checksum Generation:** Creates `addons.xml.md5` for repository integrity checks.

## Requirements

* **PHP:** 7.0 or higher
* **PHP Extensions:**  `zip`, `xml`

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:** `git clone https://github.com/your-username/kodi-repo-uploader.git`
2. **Install PHP and required extensions:**
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install -y php php-zip php-xml
Use code with caution.

(Optional) Set up a web server: While you can use the built-in PHP server for testing (php -S localhost:8000), it's recommended to use a proper web server (Apache, Nginx) for production.
Usage

Set up your repository: Click on "Repository" in the menu and configure the repository settings (ID, name, version, etc.).
Upload add-ons: Drag and drop or select ZIP files of your Kodi add-ons to upload them to the repository.
Manage add-ons: View, delete, and manage your uploaded add-ons through the web interface.
